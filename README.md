InfiRest
========

InfiRest is a library for use with Zend Framework that enables you to easily
create REST interfaces, largely inspired by
[django-tastypie](https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie).

Also included is InfiRestDoctrine, for the creation of REST interfaces for your
[Doctrine 2](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) entities.

Dependencies
============

* Zend Framework 1.11+ (might work with earlier versions).
* [Doctrine 2](http://www.doctrine-project.org/), in case you want to use
  InfiRestDoctrine,.

How this came to be
===================

Every year, my employer [Infi b.v.](http://infi.nl/) offers its individual
employees one week to work on a project of their own choice, the so-called hobby
week. InfiRest was my hobby week project for 2012.

I have used [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) for my own
toy projects in the past, and recently I messed a lot with front-end libraries
like [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) in combination
with [django-tastypie](https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie) serving
as the backend REST interface. Tastypie's ease of use inspired me to create a
similar library for Zend Framework, because we use that framework a lot in our
projects, and there is no extensive REST support in the Zend Framework core
library.

Work in progress
================

InfiRest, for now, is largely a work in progress. The goal I set for the end of
the hobby week was to have a straightforward working version with a REST-to-ORM
feature. Consequences are, among others, that the configurability of
the library could be a bit less limited. I plan to keep working on InfiRest to 
make it more mature, and ultimately, production ready.
